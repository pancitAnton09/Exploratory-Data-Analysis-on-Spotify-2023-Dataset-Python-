# Exploratory Data Analysis on Spotify's Most Streamed Songs of 2023

## What is this Project About?
* This project performs an exploratory data analysis on the Most Streamed Spotify Songs of 2023 Dataset. The goal of this project is to analyze, visualize, and interpret data to gain insights about the most popular music of the year 2023.

## What are the Steps I Did to Accomplish the Project?
* I began by familiarizing myself with the dataset’s structure, checking for missing values and identifying data types. This initial examination in Python helped me understand the features available and prepare for further analysis.

* To uncover trends and patterns, I used a variety of visualization tools such as bar charts, line plots, histograms, heatmaps, and scatter plots, ensuring each was well-labeled for easy interpretation. I also analyzed correlations between variables to provide deeper insights into potential relationships within the data.

* Finally, based on my analysis, I offered insights and recommendations regarding popular tracks, artists, and musical trends, helping to highlight factors that contribute to a track’s popularity.

## How Exactly Did I Code?
* To accomplish this project, I followed a systematic approach, in which I addressed each aspect of the exploratory data analysis (EDA) step by step. Below are the questions I answered and detailed coding procedure I undertook:
  
 ### Overview of Dataset:
* How many rows and columns does the dataset contain?
8 What are the data types of each column? Are there any missing values?

### Basic Descriptive Statistics:
* What are the mean, median, and standard deviation of the streams column?
* What is the distribution of released_year and artist_count? Are there any noticeable trends or outliers?

### Top Performers:

*Which track has the highest number of streams? Display the top 5 most streamed tracks.
*Who are the top 5 most frequent artists based on the number of tracks in the dataset?

### Temporal Trends:
* Analyze the trends in the number of tracks released over time. Plot the number of tracks released per year.
* Does the number of tracks released per month follow any noticeable patterns? Which month sees the most releases?

### Genre and Music Characteristics:
* Examine the correlation between streams and musical attributes like bpm, danceability_%, and energy_%. Which attributes seem to influence streams the most?
* Is there a correlation between danceability_% and energy_%? How about valence_% and acousticness_%?
  
### Platform Popularity:
* How do the numbers of tracks in spotify_playlists, spotify_charts, and apple_playlists compare? Which platform seems to favor the most popular tracks?

### Advanced Analysis:
* Based on the streams data, can you identify any patterns among tracks with the same key or mode (Major vs. Minor)?
* Do certain genres or artists consistently appear in more playlists or charts? Perform an analysis to compare the most frequently appearing artists in playlists or charts.
